# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as Markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`—never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` and create the directory if necessary.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally supply the path or issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md`—the Notes, Decisions-so-far, and Fog body.
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). A `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: A `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: Scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed. The first file by number wins.
- **Claim**: Set `Status: claimed` and save before work starts.
- **Resolve**: Append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, and append a context pointer (gist and link) to Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
